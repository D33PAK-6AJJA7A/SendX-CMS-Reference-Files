SendX Platform: Help Docs
1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis of the SendX email marketing platform, based on information extracted from its official support documentation. The primary objective is to structure this knowledge in a manner comprehensible to an Artificial Intelligence, enabling it to understand the platform's functionalities, interconnections, and operational nuances. The documentation covers core features, setup procedures, integration capabilities, and available support resources. A significant portion of the detailed content for specific articles was inaccessible; this report will clearly delineate between documented facts and areas where information is inferred or incomplete due to these limitations.1
The SendX platform is part of a broader suite of products by SendWorks, which also includes SendPost, SendHealth, and SendVerify, each with its own support sections.1 This document, however, focuses exclusively on SendX.
2. Overview of SendX Support Documentation Structure
The SendX support documentation, primarily hosted at https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx, is organized into several main categories and numerous specific articles. This structure is designed to guide users from initial setup to advanced feature utilization.1
An AI should recognize this hierarchical structure as a map to the platform's capabilities. The main categories provide a high-level overview of feature sets, while individual articles offer detailed instructions and explanations. The categorization itself reveals the platform's emphasis on different aspects of email marketing, such as list management, campaign creation, automation, and analytics.
Key Navigational and Support Categories Identified 1:
* SendX (Main Product Support): The central hub for all SendX-related articles.
   * Sub-sections include: Getting Started, FAQs, Common Problems, General, Advanced Topics, A/B Testing, Email Deliverability, API, Integrations, Email Automation, Settings & Setup, and specific feature categories like Newsletter Campaigns, Embedded Forms, Pop-Ups, Drips, Landing Pages, Tags, Segments, and Lists.
* Product Support for other SendWorks products: SendPost, SendHealth, SendVerify (these are outside the scope of this SendX-focused document but indicate a larger product ecosystem).
* General Navigation/Company Links: Links to the main SendWorks website and help center.
The presence of "Getting Started" sections for both the main product and specific features (e.g., video series) suggests a user onboarding process that the AI could learn. Similarly, dedicated sections for "FAQs" and "Common Problems" are indicative of areas where users frequently require assistance or encounter challenges. Understanding these patterns can help an AI anticipate user needs or troubleshoot issues.
3. Core SendX Features and Functionalities (Categorized)
This section details the core features of the SendX platform, organized by the categories found in its support documentation. Each subsection will describe the purpose and key aspects of the feature set, drawing from available information.
3.1. Getting Started

* Key Functionalities/Concepts:
   * DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): A method to verify that email content has not been tampered with. This is a critical component for sender authentication.
   * Domain Authentication (Domain Whitelisting): Involves adding specific DNS records (Return Path, DKIM, Track record) to the sender's domain settings.
* Procedure:
   1. Generate DNS records (Return Path, DKIM, Track) within SendX (implied).
   2. Add these records to the DNS settings of the user's domain provider. Specific guides are available for providers like Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Google Domains.2 A guide for Route53 AWS was indicated as "Coming Soon".2
* Troubleshooting: Users are advised to contact support@sendx.io or submit a ticket for questions.2 This indicates a direct support channel for a potentially technical setup process.

3.5. Common Problems
This section is dedicated to addressing frequent issues or points of confusion users might encounter while using SendX. A summary of common problems is available from an analysis of https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx#common-problems.14
Key common problems addressed include:

* Resending verification emails.
* Emails being clipped (i.e., not displaying fully in email clients).
* The need to disable the Grammarly browser extension, suggesting a potential conflict.
* How to delete all contacts from a SendX account.
The "Common Problems" section often reveals system behaviors, potential conflicts with third-party tools (like Grammarly), or specific platform rules (like the billing implication of deleting lists but not unassociated contacts) that might not be immediately obvious to users. An AI should internalize these as known issues or system quirks, which can be useful for diagnostic purposes or for providing proactive advice to users. For example, the "emails clipped" issue could relate to email size limits or HTML complexity, while the Grammarly issue points to a specific software incompatibility.
3.6. General (Category)
This category houses a variety of articles that don't fit neatly into other more specific sections.1 The topics are diverse, covering notifications, integrations with analytics tools, contact management, and content embedding.
Examples of article titles from 1 under "General" include:

3.9. A/B Testing
This category covers SendX's functionality for A/B testing, allowing users to compare different versions of their emails to optimize performance.1
Articles listed in 1 under A/B Testing:

Its inclusion indicates that SendX supports such methodologies. Key aspects of A/B testing usually involve setting up variations, defining test audience proportions, setting a test duration, and analyzing results to determine a winner. The article titles suggest SendX addresses these components. However, without access to the content of these guides, the AI's understanding of how SendX implements A/B testing, including its workflow and analytical capabilities, will be limited.
3.10. Bulk Actions
Functionality for performing operations on multiple contacts at once.
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/run-a-bulk-action.9
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/delete-contacts-using-bulk-actions.1 The title clearly states one of the key use cases for bulk actions: mass deletion of contacts.
3.11. Email Deliverability
This category focuses on topics crucial for ensuring emails successfully reach recipients' inboxes.1
Articles from 1 include:
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/do-we-provide-a-heatmap (Content Inaccessible - Heatmaps can visualize engagement within an email).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/gmail-dmarc-update-2016 (Content Inaccessible - Title suggests SendX tracks and informs about ISP policy changes, though this specific one is dated).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/can-spam-act.19 This refers to the US federal law regulating commercial email, indicating guidance on legal compliance.
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/how-to-add-sendx-as-a-user-to-google-postmaster-tools (Content Inaccessible). Google Postmaster Tools help senders monitor their sending reputation with Gmail.
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/prevent-emails-from-landing-under-spam.20 A critical topic for all email marketers.
This category demonstrates SendX's awareness of and provision of guidance on external factors that significantly influence email success. These include ISP policies (like DMARC and the use of Google Postmaster Tools) and legal regulations (such as the CAN-SPAM Act). Email deliverability is not solely controlled by the sending platform; it exists within an ecosystem of rules, sender reputation, and recipient engagement. By providing articles on these topics, SendX aims to educate users on these external dependencies. For an AI, this means understanding that SendX operates within, and advises users on navigating, this larger framework.
3.12. SendX API
This section covers programmatic access to SendX functionalities.1
Articles from 1:
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/rest-api (Content Inaccessible)
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/javascript-api (Content Inaccessible)
The presence of documentation for both REST and Javascript APIs indicates that SendX is designed for extensibility and integration with other systems beyond its native user interface and pre-built integrations. APIs allow developers to automate tasks, synchronize data between SendX and other applications, and build custom solutions tailored to specific business needs.
A REST API is typically used for server-to-server communication, enabling backend systems to manage data (like contacts or lists) or trigger actions (like sending campaigns) within SendX. A Javascript API is often used for client-side interactions, such as embedding SendX functionality into websites (e.g., for advanced form submissions or event tracking) or interacting with SendX features directly from the user's browser.
Even without the specific details of API endpoints and methods (due to inaccessible content), an AI should recognize API availability as a significant feature for advanced users or organizations with complex technology stacks requiring custom integrations.
3.13. Email Service Provider (ESP) Integration Guides
This category lists guides for integrating SendX with other Email Service Providers, which could potentially be used for the underlying email sending infrastructure.1
Articles from 1:
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/mailgun-integration-guide (Content Inaccessible)
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/sendgrid-integration-guide (Content Inaccessible)
Mailgun and Sendgrid are well-known email delivery services (often referred to as ESPs or SMTP providers). If SendX integrates with them, it could imply that users have the option to use SendX primarily for its marketing automation, campaign management, and contact management features, while leveraging these third-party ESPs for the actual dispatch of emails. This architecture would offer flexibility, particularly for users who have already established sending reputations with these providers or have specific deliverability needs met by them. An AI should note this as a potential architectural aspect of SendX, allowing for a modular approach to the email sending stack.
3.14. Feeds (RSS / Atom / XML)
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/feeds 1
The existence of a "Feeds" category suggests that SendX may support the use of RSS, Atom, or XML feeds as content sources for email campaigns. A common application of this is "RSS-to-Email," where new content from a blog feed (for example) automatically triggers an email newsletter to subscribers. This automates content distribution and keeps audiences updated with the latest posts or information.
3.15. Integrations
This category details SendX's ability to connect with various third-party services, enhancing its functionality and allowing it to operate within a broader marketing technology ecosystem.1
Examples of integration articles from 1:
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/does-sendx-integrate-with-zapier.21 Zapier is a major automation platform that connects thousands of web apps, so a Zapier integration would significantly expand SendX's connectivity.
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/woo-commerce-integration.34

* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/convertbox-integration (Content Inaccessible).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/solitics-integration-setup (Content Inaccessible).
The extensive list of integrations, even with most guides being inaccessible, demonstrates SendX's strategy to be a well-connected component in a user's marketing technology stack. These integrations likely facilitate data exchange and workflow automation with e-commerce platforms (WooCommerce, SamCart), payment processors (PayPal, Stripe), CRM systems (Pipedrive), landing page builders (Instapage, ClickFunnels), course platforms (Teachable), and general automation hubs (Zapier). No marketing tool operates in isolation, and these connections allow users to create more holistic, automated marketing systems where data from various touchpoints can inform and trigger actions within SendX. An AI should understand SendX not as a standalone application but as a platform capable of interacting with a diverse range of external services.
3.16. Email Automation
This category is central to SendX's value proposition, focusing on automating email workflows based on various triggers and conditions. 11 lists article titles under this section but states that detailed summaries are unavailable.

The article "How And For Whom Does An Automation Work" implies a need to clearly explain the underlying logic, scope, and triggering conditions of SendX automations. An AI should recognize "Automation" as a powerful, logic-driven feature set within SendX, designed to save time, personalize communication at scale, and react to user behaviors or external system events.

This category covers the fundamental task of sending one-off email campaigns. However, the article titles also indicate that SendX provides features beyond simple broadcasting, including tools for performance optimization (e.g., based on open activity, time zones, resending to non-openers) and personalization. This focus suggests that SendX encourages a results-driven approach to newsletter campaigns. An AI should understand these as levers available to users for improving the outcomes of their broadcast emails.
3.20. Embedded Forms
This section details the use of embedded forms, a primary method for capturing leads directly from a user's website.15 lists article titles and brief inferred purposes for this category.
Article titles from 5:
* "Embed A Form On Your Wordpress Website Or Blog" (https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/embed-a-form-on-your-wordpress-website-or-blog 24).

Embedded forms are not merely passive data collection tools within SendX; they are designed to be active components integrated into broader marketing workflows. For example, the ability to "Start A Drip Sequence When A User Subscribes To Your Form" or "Add Leads From A Form To A Specific List" demonstrates that forms serve as entry points into automated nurturing sequences and audience segmentation processes. Furthermore, the mention of "Check The Analytics Of Your Form" implies that SendX provides data on form performance, allowing users to optimize their lead generation efforts. An AI should perceive embedded forms as dynamic elements within the SendX ecosystem, linking website interactions to backend marketing processes.
3.21. Pop-Ups
This category provides information on using pop-up forms, another common strategy for lead capture and engagement on websites.1 Some content on integrating pop-ups is available from 2525 and.1414
* Key Functionalities 14:
   * Creating pop-ups within SendX.
   * Integrating pop-ups on any website using a Javascript snippet placed before the closing </body> tag.25
   * Customizing pop-up behavior (e.g., timing, triggers - implied).
   * Targeting pop-ups based on website URL. This requires prefixing the URL with .* (e.g., .*yourdomain.com/*) and ensuring the pop-up status is active.25
   * Direct WordPress integration using the "Email Marketing by SendX" plugin, designed for easier setup by non-technical users.14
* Step-by-Step General Website Integration 25:
   1. Obtain the Javascript snippet from SendX settings (implied).
   2. Install this snippet on every page of the website, just before the closing </body> tag.
   3. Edit the desired pop-up in SendX and navigate to its "Targeting Section."
   4. Paste the target website URL (prefixed with .*) into the targeting rules, set the status to active, and submit/save.
* Step-by-Step WordPress Integration 14:
   1. Download the "Email Marketing by SendX" plugin.14
   2. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New.
   3. Click "Upload Plugin," choose the downloaded plugin file, and click "Install Now."

SendX offers multiple methods for integrating pop-ups, catering to different user needs and technical abilities. The general Javascript snippet method provides flexibility for any website, while the dedicated WordPress plugin simplifies the process for users on that platform. This dual approach aims to maximize compatibility and ease of use. An AI should understand these alternative pathways for implementing the same core feature (pop-up display and lead capture).
3.22. Drips
Drip campaigns are automated sequences of emails sent to contacts over time, typically triggered by a specific action or condition. This is a core feature for lead nurturing and sustained engagement.1
1 lists many specific article titles for Drips, suggesting a rich feature set. Examples include:
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-your-first-drip-sequence.8

* "How To Delay Sending The 1st Email After A User Subscribes To A Drip"
* "Stop a Drip When a User Replies to a Drip Email"
* "How To Stop A Drip On Various User Triggers"
Although the detailed content of most drip-related articles is inaccessible, the titles themselves strongly suggest a high degree of control, sophisticated logic, and comprehensive functionality within SendX's Drip campaigns. Features indicated include:
* Triggering and Termination: Starting and stopping drip sequences based on a wide array of user actions (subscribing to a list, tag being added/removed) or engagement (replying to an email, unsubscribing).
* Content and Formatting: Using email templates, embedding videos, and choosing between drag-and-drop or plain text editors.
* Scheduling and Timing: Options to send emails immediately, introduce delays, respect time zones, and skip weekends.
* Analytics: Capabilities to check the performance of drip campaigns.
* Use Cases: Support for outbound prospecting in addition to traditional inbound lead nurturing.
An AI should infer that Drip campaigns in SendX are a powerful and highly configurable automation tool, central to nurturing leads and engaging contacts over extended periods. The variety of triggers, conditions, and scheduling options points to a flexible system designed to adapt to complex marketing scenarios, even if the precise implementation mechanisms are not detailed in the accessible materials.
3.23. Landing Pages
This category covers the creation and management of landing pages within SendX, which are standalone web pages designed for specific campaigns or conversion goals.1
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-your-first-landing-page.6 Other article titles from 1 under "Landing Pages" suggest further functionalities:

* "Add Leads From a Landing Page to a Specific List"
* "Add A Countdown Timer In Landing Page" (Urgency marketing tactic).
* "Check The Analytics Of Your Landing Page" (Performance measurement). Most of these articles are presumed inaccessible. Landing pages in SendX appear to be more than static pages; they are integrated with other platform features like forms, pop-ups, drip sequences, list management, and analytics, and allow for customization and third-party widget embedding.
3.24. Tags
Tags are flexible labels used to categorize, segment, and organize contacts within SendX, often based on their behavior, interests, or status.1 They play a crucial role in enabling dynamic segmentation and triggering automated workflows.
* Definition: Tags are "Used to segregate contacts based on activity, event, or other such attributes".28 Articles from 1 related to Tags:
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/product-tags.10 This was listed under "Getting Started."
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/how-to-delete-a-tag-with-all-its-contacts.29 This article mentions that SendX makes this process "extremely easy" and can be done "in just a few clicks," with a video available to demonstrate. However, text-based step-by-step instructions are not provided in the snippet.
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-and-map-new-custom-fields-while-importing-contacts-into-a-tag (Content Inaccessible).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/import-contacts-into-a-tag.30
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/export-contacts-from-a-tag (Content Inaccessible).
Tags serve as a dynamic organizational layer, often reflecting real-time changes in a contact's profile or engagement level. Unlike static lists, tags can be applied or removed automatically based on various criteria or actions. As indicated by article titles in the "Drips" (Section 3.22) and "Email Automation" (Section 3.16) categories (e.g., "How To Start A Drip When A Tag Gets Added To A User," "How To Stop A Drip When A Tag Is Removed From A Contact"), tags are integral to triggering and controlling automated sequences. An AI should understand tags as a versatile tool for micro-segmentation and as key conditions in automation rules.
3.25. Segments
Segments in SendX allow for advanced, rule-based grouping of contacts for highly targeted communication. They offer more sophisticated filtering than simple lists or tags.
3.25.1. Create Your First Segment (https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-your-first-segment)
* Source: 39
* Purpose: To guide users on creating segments in SendX to enable precise targeting of emails and improve marketing effectiveness.
* Key Functionalities:
   * Segment Naming: Assigning a descriptive name to the segment.
   * Conditional Logic (AND/OR): Users can specify whether contacts must meet all (AND) or any (OR) of the defined criteria to be included in the segment. This is fundamental for building complex queries.
   * Criteria Definition:
      * Field Selection: Choosing a contact field (e.g., "Location," custom fields, engagement data) from a drop-down menu.
      * Condition Selection: Selecting an operator (e.g., "is," "is not," "contains," "greater than") that defines how the field's value will be evaluated.
      * Value Input: Providing the specific value to match against the chosen field and condition.
* Step-by-Step Procedure:
   1. Navigate to Audience > Segments from the main menu.
   2. Click to create a new segment.
   3. Provide a suitable Name for the segment.
   4. Choose the desired overall condition: AND (all sub-conditions must be true) or OR (any sub-condition can be true).
   5. For each criterion: a. Open the drop-down menu and select the desired field (e.g., "Location"). b. Choose the desired condition from the next drop-down menu. c. Add the specific value in the field below (e.g., "New York").
   6. Click Submit to save the segment.
* Definitions:
   * Segments (implied): Groups of contacts defined by specific conditions, used for targeted marketing.
   * AND condition: A contact must meet all specified criteria to be included.
   * OR condition: A contact must meet any of the specified criteria to be included.
3.25.2. Segmentation (Conceptual Guide) (https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/segmentation)
* Source: 28
* Purpose: To explain the concept of segmentation and its effective use for better email targeting, differentiating segments from more basic organizational tools like lists and tags.
* Key Concepts:
   * Segments vs. Lists/Tags: Lists are collections of contacts, and tags segregate contacts based on attributes or activities. Segments, however, group contacts who comply with a specific condition or a group of complex conditions, making them suitable for scenarios where lists and tags alone are insufficient for precise targeting.
   * Use Cases for Segments:
      * Sending targeted broadcast email campaigns.
      * Viewing in-depth analytics for specific behaviors (e.g., contacts on a list, who haven't clicked in a campaign, and haven't replied).
      * Performing bulk operations on a defined group of contacts.
      * Triggering actions via automation rules when a contact is added to a segment.
      * Excluding contacts within a segment from specific steps in a drip campaign.
* Example of Condition Breakdown: To segment contacts who are registered (on a list), have created a profile (tag), shared on Facebook (tag), and have been sent specific campaigns, these conditions are combined within a segment definition.
* Definitions:
   * Lists: A collection of contacts.
   * Tags: Used to segregate contacts based on activity, event, or other attributes.
   * Segments: Used to get a group of contacts who comply with a condition or a group of conditions.
Other segment-related article titles from 1, such as "Create a Segment of all Non Openers" (https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-a-segment-of-all-non-openers 31), "Create A Segment With LTV" (Lifetime Value), "Create a Segment with Date," and "Create an AND OR Segment With Nested Groups," further suggest the advanced and flexible nature of SendX's segmentation capabilities.
Segments are a powerful, rule-based method for dynamically grouping contacts. Unlike static lists or simpler tags, they allow for complex, multi-conditional logic to define highly specific audiences. 28 explicitly highlights their utility for complex criteria, and 39 details the rule engine involving AND/OR logic and field-condition-value setups. The mention of "Nested Groups" implies an even greater depth of logical construction. An AI should understand segments as dynamically calculated groups that evolve as contact data and attributes change, enabling precise and timely targeting for marketing communications.
3.26. Lists
Lists are fundamental containers for organizing contacts within SendX.1
* Definition: A list is "A collection of contacts".3 Article titles from 1 related to Lists:
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/lists (Content Inaccessible - likely a general overview page for lists).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/how-to-delete-a-list-with-all-its-contacts (Content Inaccessible).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/how-to-export-unsubscribers-list (Content Inaccessible).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/export-contacts-from-a-list.32
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-a-single-opt-in-list-with-a-thank-you-email (Content Inaccessible).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-and-map-new-custom-fields-while-importing-contacts-in-a-list (Content Inaccessible).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/check-the-analytics-of-your-list (Content Inaccessible).
* https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/create-a-double-opt-in-list.33 The title indicates support for Double Opt-In (DOI), a best practice for confirming subscriber consent and improving list quality.
While tags and segments offer more dynamic and granular organization, lists often serve as the initial or primary containers for contacts. As seen in the documentation for importing contacts 3, creating landing pages 6, and the summaries for embedded forms 5 and pop-ups (Section 3.21), new leads are typically added to a specific list. This establishes lists as foundational grouping mechanisms, often tied to acquisition sources (e.g., "Website Signups List," "Imported Leads List") or broad audience categories, before more detailed tagging or segmentation might occur.
4. SendX Integrations Framework
SendX is designed to connect with a variety of third-party services, allowing it to function as a central hub within a broader marketing technology stack. This connectivity facilitates data flow, extends functionality, and enables automated workflows that span multiple platforms.
4.1. Overview of Integration Capabilities
The SendX support documentation dedicates entire categories and numerous articles to integrations, covering connections with e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, payment processors, webinar tools, automation hubs like Zapier, and even other Email Service Providers (ESPs) for sending infrastructure.1 This breadth of documented integrations (even if many specific guides are inaccessible) points to a strategic emphasis on openness and interoperability.
The general purpose of these integrations appears to be twofold:
1. Feeding data into SendX: Events or data from external systems (e.g., a new customer in WooCommerce, a deal update in Pipedrive, a payment in Stripe) can trigger automations or update contact profiles within SendX, enabling more timely and relevant marketing actions.
2. Extending SendX's functionality: Leveraging specialized external services (e.g., using Mailgun/Sendgrid for email dispatch, connecting to Zapier for wider app automation) can enhance SendX's core capabilities or allow users to utilize preferred existing tools.
This approach suggests that SendX is not intended to be a monolithic, closed system but rather a flexible platform that can adapt to users' existing technology ecosystems and evolving needs. For an AI, understanding this philosophy of connectivity is crucial for comprehending SendX's role in a typical user's MarTech stack.
4.2. Specific Integration Guides
4.2.1. WooCommerce Integration (https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/woo-commerce-integration)
* Source: 34
* Purpose: This guide details how to enable and configure the integration between a WooCommerce e-commerce store and SendX.
* Key Functionalities Enabled by Integration:
   * Automatic Contact Creation: When a new customer is created in WooCommerce, a corresponding contact is automatically created in SendX.
   * Order & Product Data Sync: Detailed order and product information from WooCommerce purchases are made visible within the SendX contact profile.
   * Lifetime Value (LTV) Tracking: SendX can track the LTV of each WooCommerce customer.
   * E-commerce Segmentation: Users can segment contacts in SendX based on WooCommerce data, such as:
      * Products or categories purchased.
      * Coupon usage.
      * Purchase of specific products within a defined timeframe.
   * Automatic Tagging: Contacts created or updated via WooCommerce (i.e., they made a purchase) are automatically tagged with via_woocommerce.
   * Automatic LTV Calculation: LTV is calculated based on all past purchases.
* Setup Procedure (Webhook-based):
   1. In the WooCommerce admin panel, navigate to Settings > Advanced > Webhooks.
   2. Click "Add webhook."
   3. Name the webhook (e.g., "SendX Order Created").
   4. Set Status to "Active."
   5. Choose the Topic (event) that will trigger the webhook (e.g., "Order created"). Other events like "Customer created" might also be relevant.
   6. Provide the Delivery URL: https://app.sendx.io/api/v1/integration/woocommerce/team/<teamid>. The <teamid> is specific to the user's SendX account and can be found in SendX Settings.
   7. Save the Webhook. A success message ("Webhook updated successfully") should appear.
   8. Verification involves placing a test order in the WooCommerce store with a new customer email. This should result in a new contact in SendX with associated billing and purchase details visible in their timeline.
* Data Exchange Mechanism: The integration relies on WooCommerce webhooks. When a specified event occurs in WooCommerce (e.g., an order is created), WooCommerce sends a real-time HTTP POST request containing the event data to the unique SendX API endpoint (Delivery URL).
* Associated SendX Features Leveraged: Contact creation, custom fields (implied for storing order details, LTV), tags (e.g., via_woocommerce), segmentation engine, and the contact timeline (for displaying purchase history).
The WooCommerce integration exemplifies a deep data synchronization designed to empower e-commerce marketing automation directly from SendX. By having access to detailed purchase history and customer data within SendX, users can create highly targeted campaigns (e.g., abandoned cart reminders (inferred capability), post-purchase follow-ups, recommendations for related products, loyalty offers based on LTV or purchase frequency). The use of webhooks is a common and efficient method for event-driven data exchange between cloud platforms, enabling near real-time updates in SendX as events occur in WooCommerce. This is a scalable integration pattern that an AI should recognize as potentially applicable to other SendX integrations as well.

5. SendX API Reference (Based on Available Data)
SendX provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow for programmatic interaction with its platform, enabling custom development, advanced automation, and deeper integration with external systems.
5.1. Introduction to SendX APIs
The SendX support documentation lists pages for both a REST API (https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/rest-api) and a Javascript API (https://www.sendworks.com/support/sendx/javascript-api).1 While the specific technical documentation detailing endpoints, methods, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms for these APIs was inaccessible within the provided materials, their mere existence is significant.
The offering of both REST and Javascript APIs suggests that SendX caters to different types of programmatic interaction:
* REST API: Typically used for server-side or backend integrations. This would allow other applications or custom scripts to manage data within SendX (e.g., add/update contacts, manage lists, retrieve campaign data) and trigger actions (e.g., initiate email sends) from a server environment.
* Javascript API: Generally used for client-side or frontend interactions, directly within a user's web browser. This could be used for embedding SendX functionality into websites (e.g., custom form submissions that directly feed into SendX, tracking website visitor activity to trigger automations) or interacting with SendX features without navigating to the SendX application interface.
An AI should understand this dual API approach as providing comprehensive programmatic access, suitable for a wide range of development use cases.
5.2. Core API Functionalities (Inferred/General)
Based on common functionalities of email marketing platform APIs and article titles such as "How can I add contacts to a list using API importing?" 11 (found under the Email Automation category), it is possible to infer some likely capabilities of the SendX APIs. These might include, but are not limited to:
* Contact Management:
   * Adding new contacts.
   * Updating existing contact information and custom fields.
   * Deleting contacts.
   * Adding or removing tags from contacts.
   * Subscribing or unsubscribing contacts from lists.
* List Management:
   * Creating and deleting lists.
   * Retrieving list information and members.
* Campaign Management:
   * Triggering the sending of email campaigns or drip sequences.
   * Retrieving campaign statistics and analytics.
* Data Retrieval:
   * Fetching contact details and engagement history.
   * Accessing analytics data for various platform entities.
APIs are fundamental for users who need to:
* Build custom integrations with systems not covered by SendX's pre-built options.
* Implement complex or proprietary automation logic that goes beyond the capabilities of the SendX UI.
* Synchronize SendX data with internal databases or business intelligence systems.
* Embed SendX functionalities seamlessly into their own applications or websites.
For an AI, recognizing that these programmatic hooks likely exist is important, even if the specific syntax, endpoints, and authentication methods are unknown from the current dataset. The API effectively makes SendX a programmable platform.
6. Consolidated Troubleshooting and FAQs

7.2. Summary of Inaccessible Content and Potential Data Gaps
A significant number of specific support articles linked from the main SendX support page were inaccessible or did not have their content detailed in the provided materials. This has resulted in several knowledge gaps for the AI's understanding of the SendX platform. Key areas affected include:
* Detailed "How-To" for Core Features: While the existence of many features is known (e.g., A/B testing, creating drip sequences, pop-ups, specific API functionalities), the step-by-step procedures, nuances of configuration, and advanced options are often missing. For example, specific guides on How To Do A/B Testing On Subject Line 18 or Create Your First Drip Sequence 8 were inaccessible.
* API Specifications: Detailed documentation for the REST API and Javascript API (endpoints, methods, parameters, authentication) is unavailable.1 This limits the AI's ability to understand the precise programmatic interaction capabilities.
* Advanced Feature Details: Many articles under "Advanced Topics," "Advanced," and specific optimization features (e.g., Optimize Your Campaign Performance Based On Users' Open Activity 22) lack content, preventing a deep understanding of SendX's more sophisticated functionalities.
* Specific Integration Guides: While the WooCommerce integration is well-documented 34, details for most other integrations (Zapier, PayPal, Stripe, Pipedrive, ESP integrations like Mailgun/Sendgrid, etc.) are missing.1
* Email Deliverability Best Practices: Articles like Prevent emails from landing under spam 20 and CAN SPAM Act 19 were inaccessible, limiting detailed knowledge in this critical area.
* IP Warm-up Procedures: The guide for IP warm-up 4 was inaccessible, which is a crucial topic for new senders.
* Video Content: All video tutorials were, by their nature, inaccessible for content extraction.
These gaps mean that while the AI can gain a good structural overview of SendX and understand the purpose of many of its features, its knowledge of the specific implementation details, advanced configurations, and troubleshooting for many areas will be limited. This report transparently reflects these limitations.
8. Conclusion
The SendX platform, as evidenced by its support documentation structure and available content, presents itself as a comprehensive email marketing solution catering to a range of user needs, from basic list management and newsletter campaigns to sophisticated automation, segmentation, and integrations. Key functionalities revolve around contact management (lists, tags, custom fields, segments), campaign creation (newsletters, drips, landing pages, forms, pop-ups), automation workflows, A/B testing, and analytics.
SendX emphasizes adherence to email marketing best practices, with features and guidance related to domain authentication, opt-in mechanisms (implied by Double Opt-In list creation), and deliverability. The platform is designed for extensibility, offering APIs (REST and Javascript) and a wide array of integrations with third-party services, positioning it as a connectable component within a larger marketing technology stack.
However, the AI's current understanding is constrained by the accessibility of detailed content for numerous specific support articles. While the "what" (features available) and often the "why" (purpose of features) are discernible, the "how" (detailed implementation, specific configurations, advanced nuances) is frequently incomplete. The AI should be aware of these knowledge gaps, particularly concerning detailed API specifications, advanced feature operations, and specific troubleshooting steps for many scenarios.
Despite these limitations, this documentation provides a foundational understanding of the SendX platform's architecture, core capabilities, and intended use cases, enabling an AI to reason about its functionalities and its role in the email marketing landscape.
